<!-- Introduction -->
<p>In this lab, I'll guide you through the lifecycle of tickets from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system, osTicket.</p>

<!-- Ticket Creation -->
<p>To create tickets, users enter the ticket portal, log in if necessary, and submit a ticket request, detailing their IT-related issues. Here, I've created three sample tickets, each addressing different problems that might occur in a real environment. Tickets are created using a Help Topic, a descriptive outline, and issue details, all formatted as if it were an email.</p>

<!-- Admin Perspective -->

<!-- Admin Handling -->
<p>From an admin perspective, ticket requests are received in their panel. Admins can reassign tickets to an agent or an appropriate team, determine the severity level, and ensure timely resolution within the SLA. In the example, Jane viewed a ticket, assigned it to the System Administrators, and changed the severity level to Emergency.</p>

<!-- Communication and Documentation -->
<p>When resolving tickets, effective communication is crucial. Collaboration with the team and affected users is essential. Tickets are assigned appropriately, and proper documentation is vital for future reference. Strong communication and documentation contribute to a successful environment.</p>

<!-- Conclusion -->
<p>The protocols for managing tickets may vary depending on the work environment. Quotas for resolving tickets within a certain timeframe and prioritization of tickets based on situations are common. Through building osTicket from scratch, I gained insights into how tickets function in an IT position.</p>
